While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the `expo prebuild` command.  The error message wasn't particularly informative, simply stating that the prebuild process failed without specifying the root cause.  My project uses several native modules and custom configurations, making it difficult to isolate the issue. The build would start and then seemingly hang indefinitely before ultimately failing.
