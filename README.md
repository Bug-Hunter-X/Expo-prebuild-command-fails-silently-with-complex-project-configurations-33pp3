# Expo prebuild Failure with Unclear Error Message

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the `expo prebuild` command in an Expo project with multiple native modules and custom configurations. The `expo prebuild` command fails without providing a clear or actionable error message, making debugging extremely challenging.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Attempt to run `expo prebuild`. Observe that the process hangs indefinitely before ultimately failing with a generic error message.

## Expected Behavior

The `expo prebuild` command should complete successfully or provide a detailed error message indicating the source of the problem.

## Actual Behavior

The `expo prebuild` command fails without a helpful error message, making it difficult to identify and resolve the underlying issue.

## Potential Solutions (Investigate)

* Examine logs for more detailed error information.
* Simplify the project configuration to identify conflicting elements.
* Temporarily disable native modules to determine if they're causing the issue.
* Update dependencies to the latest versions.
* Check Expo CLI version and update if necessary. 
* Test with a clean project to rule out issues related to the project's codebase.

## Note
This issue has been reported to the Expo team for investigation and resolution.
